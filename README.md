# [SDF05] Project Brief: Blackjack Game on GitHub

In this project, I recreate a popular card game. With the assistance of Scrimba, I followed along and made updates to my local code to replicate their simple BlackJack game.

### Project Requirements

- Setup up your own Starter Code SDF05 Repo
- Code along in VSCode with Scrimba
- Build and customise your version of the Blackjack game.
- Ensure the game operates smoothly and maintains a consistent style.
- Submit your GitHub Repo link of your completed BlackJack Game to the LMS on the SDF05 Project Tab

### Project Challenges

- Having to learn arrays took me quite some time as I couldn't grasp it immediately.
- The code from the Scrimba lessons contained a bug, but I was able to correct it within a few minutes.
- I struggled thinking of CSS styling, so I played it safe with simple borders and formatting.
